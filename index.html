              <p>My name is Mario Macias, and I am a student at UC Berkeley, Extension attending their coding bootcamp. My interest in computers and programing started when I was about 7 years old when my uncle would send me parts to build Apple iie computers. I then started diving into building websites when I was getting my associates in Business Amdinistration with a minor in Computer Science. I was really enjoying computer science, and even built my mom a website for her jewlery store. I graduated with my associates in 2003, and then took approximately 4 years off in order to party and put a lot of time into my DJing, but it was not paying the bills. 
              </p>
              <p>
              Fastforward to 2007, and I started school to obtain my Bachelors. Not in Computer Science, but in Psychology with a minor in Sociology. I looked at jobs, and there were not many jobs with a Bachelors in Psychology, but upon additional research, I was able to find that you could get a decent paying job IF, you go back to school; go into more debt, and spend another 2 years of school to obtain your Masters Degree. That is when I decided to get my Master's in Clinical Psychology. I started doing some coding again back in 2013 by using code academy, but was focusing on starting my career. In 2009, I started being a counselor, and never gave coding much thought again. 
            </p>
            <p>
              When I graduated with my degree, I thought I would be happy since I received my degree, and no one else in my family was a college grad. I started my career, but it was very taxing, and the demands were very unreasonable, and I was spending a lot of time outside of home, and I was struggling to find my place in the therapy world for the last 11 years of my career, and I felt it was time for a change since having my daughter while I was in school.  
            </p>
            <p>
              I took some time off to focus my attention on my daughter, but before she was born, I was in a place where my job was not where I wanted to be, and took a lot out of me. However, grateful for the opportunity. I felt like learning to code would give me the opportunity to spend time with my family. At the job where I am at today as a Social Worker with Child Protective Services, I don't have the flexibility regarding my schedule, and I would be at work until 10p most days. 
            </p>
            <p>
              So here I am today, learning to code, and it was a really difficult beginning, but I would not change my decision to learn how to code, and I am happy I made the choice to stick with it.
